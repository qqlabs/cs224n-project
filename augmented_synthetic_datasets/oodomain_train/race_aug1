Sounds unbelievable, doesn't infor", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A house of cards? Sounds unbelievable, doesn't information technology? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles-- and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structure are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding acting cards. He never use glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cellular telephone made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which make believe a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it lavatory carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \" story \" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \" big, old farm \" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, \" Bryan remembers, \" with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like stick or bales of hay. \" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests-- building and card stacking-- soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \" Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level, \" he reports. \" And they weren't very firm. When people walked around, it was like'earthquake action.'It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall down immediately. \" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? William jennings bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's  tallest card tower  came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he's gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3. 5 inches and used about 2, 400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan like to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The leaden the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be at the top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed.

The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Wellness and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \" The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms, \" the authors say. \" Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently. \" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a match-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA).

The inside of the earth is comparatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth be about 4, 000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest maw in Siberia, but bottomed verboten at about  septet. 5 miles  below the surface. The Mohole project, a U. S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantelpiece. Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily discontinue at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust---about 52, 800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What niggling we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten atomic number 26 into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2, 000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out information to the surface.

Because we can't see what we can't see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in bootleg, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the globe. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen hoops tosses. Hands went up all over. He so asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect  15 . Then he asked, \" And who saw the gorilla? \" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organise principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they consider the shortcomings of the individual, Ane sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital eld, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them.

However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have found that many couples in reality feel happier when their children leave home because they are able bodied to enjoy spending time together. In total, 123 American mothers born in the thirties were tracked for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after marrying, when they were bringing up babies, once their children reached their teenage years and finally  at age 61, when almost all had \" empty nests  \". Although not all said they were happier in general, most claimed their marriages had improved since their children had left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses were spending more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the participants in the study, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, said: \" Once the kids grow up... there's some of that stress removed... that responsibility removed, so things are a little more relaxed. \" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who carried out the investigation, said: \" The takehome message for couples with young children be'hang in there '. \" Her coauthor Oliver John added: \" Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner. \" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe, from the British Psychological Society, said the effects of living in an \" empty nest \" will depend on the parent'relationship with their children. \" If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life, then of trend you'll be pleased to see them go, \" she say, \" But if you've built your lifetime around your children you'll comprise terribly lonely.

How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear-road traffic current. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, have previously developed models for dealings flow. One of the first attempts to pose traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser. At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density become too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \" carrying capacity \" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how block might depend on the race conditions-for example, for different commence procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the backward have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups harmonize to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in key Germany, which attracts around 6, 000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further rearwards from the bridge could the danger be avoided-and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no  dangerous blocking  seemed likely for the tunnel route. The ravel organizers consulted Treiber's squad, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "id": "1c8386576708f24f5bd896e1d6110ab7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2965, "text": "dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Motherhood may make woman smarter and may help preve", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Motherhood may make woman smarter and may help prevent dementia in old age by bathing the brain in protective hormones, U.

Where our kids go to school might matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children develop up to be successful. In a 2001 study,  Greg Duncan , a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school. Duncan and his team found almost no human relationship between how students did on the test and whom they sat beside in class, whom they hung out with after school and who lived in their block. The only meaningful link they found was between sib and twins in particular. For a long time, scholars think that a family's income heavily affected how well kids did in life. But that mightiness not be the case. When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family unit income and lifetime achievement, she ran a series of experiments to measure it, finding such outcomes weren't caused by income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a kid have or how often his family goes to museums.

Jurist Richard Leon rule in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal prescript which require large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a numb body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear. Congress called for color1 images showing the danger of smoking, similar to what  Canada  perform. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Judge Leon say the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be strictly factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \" obvious anti-smoking agenda? \" The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision \" wrong on the science and wrong on the law \".

Most hybrid cars on the route right now comprise petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just what it sounds like-- a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank, which supplies petrol to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provides electricity for the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to run at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be capable of being refuel quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with the other traffic on the route. A petrol car meets these requirements but acquire a turgid amount of pollution. An electrical car, however, produces almost no pollution, only can only go 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharging. And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to recharge.

In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most muscular. \" The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to babble about their feelings, \" says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \" The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative. \" In fact, the person who says \" I bed you \" first may also be the one who says \" I'm bored with you'first. \" Hall believes that much depends on how \" I love you \" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they're drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is \" Please don't be unfaithful to me \"? By saying \" I love you \", they are really saying \" Do you love me? \" If so, wouldn't it just be more honest to say that. Collins agrees that  intention  is everything. \" It's not what is said, but how it's tell. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker. \"", "qas": [{"question": "What is the most important for you to consider when somebody say \"I love you\" to you?", "id": "4cf3dcce4754b94f143bcefa2fdb8b3c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1869, "text": "intention"}]}]}]}, {"title": "You're in your office when you learn there's someone", "paragraphs": [{"context": "You're in your office when you learn there's someone with a gun wandering outside. You can hear gunshots and screams. What do you do? That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees how to deal with an active shooter situation in the work. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active hitman situation is when an armed somebody or people actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intention to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in US history, with 49 people killed in a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, exploiter have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office-- a calculator or a loving cup a pair of scissors-as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shooter training. Gallo says, which typically teachers people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \" lock down \" method is often  ineffective , he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the training's basic level, no one gets bolt down. But as the trainings become more advanced, players who make a wrong alternative be shot. There's no lineage; the screen just turns black slowly. If this sounds terrifying, that's the point, says Gallo. There are hatful of training programs to instruct employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving persona play with toy guns. But these trainings are basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even enjoying themselves. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they need to make up scared. \" SurviVR will take the fear and turn it into confidence. \" Gallo says.", "qas": [{"question": "What does Gallo think of the training programs involving role play with toy guns?", "id": "607fde26671e9ec78064b2a48bb88e8f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1256, "text": "ineffective"}]}]}]}, {"title": "_ (from How Doh Animals Motility?)

Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree. How Do Animals Adapt? andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive geographic expedition of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series, The Science of Animation Things. InHow Do Animals Adapt? readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, dark, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explain in double page spreads with examples clearly draw in photographs and diagram and developed through their accompanying captions. As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move? Beginning with a description of the account of movement, the reader is exposed to the many unlike ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional variations (e. g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the  photographs and diagrams  plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology is featured in. Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the textual matter. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (east. g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools. Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers.", "qas": [{"question": "What help to understand the articles in the books?", "id": "e76576115ff7e94173f6eb098440594b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1168, "text": "photographs and diagrams"}]}]}]}]}
