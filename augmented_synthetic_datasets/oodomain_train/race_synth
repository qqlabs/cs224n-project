One way in which this works is by wearing different color1s of clothes. Normally when we are sad, we will wear dark color1ed clothes. Oppositely, when we are happy, we often choose to wear brightly color1ed clothes. The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors is how we are feeling. Those who don't believe in the idea are often heard saying, \"if only this truly worked\". Well in reply to those people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear just one color1 of clothes. It has been proven that if we wear particular color1s of clothes they can change our feelings. Suppose we are feeling sad, if we wear black we may begin to feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we may begin to feel better. Each color1 is said to have its own healing power. So remember, if you are not feeling your best, you can always try out some different color1ed clothes. If one color1 has no effect on your feelings, maybe another will.", "qas": [{"question": "What type of clothes do we usually wear when we are sad?", "id": "010af07fd796942a491c2cd891164005", "answers": [{"answer_start": 189, "text": "dark color1ed"}]}, {"question": "What is the reason for choosing color1 mirrors?", "id": "59e1a00b4192072c5bf07f77209a6a10", "answers": [{"answer_start": 354, "text": "how we are feeling"}]}, {"question": "How many people feel when they are asked to wear a color1 of clothes?", "id": "8b9f1443e4947f5cbc495b9504be4b8c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 552, "text": "one"}]}, {"question": "What can a person's feelings do if they wear color1s of clothes?", "id": "9e1a6f053576b5f40b6826ea57f9a6ec", "answers": [{"answer_start": 697, "text": "change our feelings"}]}]}]}, {"title": "I had about 10 minutes to exercise before I had to p", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I had about 10 minutes to exercise before I had to pick up my two older daughters from school yesterday.

Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to regret and prepare for Christ's death and coming back to life. Modern Brazilian Carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later taking in elements of Native American and African cultures. In the late 19th century, the strings were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally connected with particular neighborhoods; they include both a music group and a lot of revelers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase each year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade in sections of the city, often near the beach. Carnival time in Rio is very interesting, but is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other lodgings can be up to four times more expensive than the regular rates.

The Belgian born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \"We're going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event,\" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock. \"So it's not the person, and it's not the music. It's more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, that's a social phenomenon.\". It will look at business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political themes, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood, it says. Prof Deflem said he initially planned to call the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity, and to use Lady Gaga as an example. Also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, Prof Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on 9 January 2009. \"They don't have to be hardcore fans.

Popular wisdom has it that parents' relationships may suffer once their young fly the coop, because they feel they have lost their purpose in life.However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that many couples actually feel happier when their children leave home because they are able to enjoy spending time together. In total,123 American mothers born in the 1930s were tracked for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after marrying, when they were bringing up babies, once their children reached their teenage years and finally at age 61, when almost all had \"empty nests\". Although not all said they were happier in general, most claimed their marriages had improved since their children had left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses were spending more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the participants in the study,which is published in the journal Psychological Science,said:\"Once the kids grow up...there's some of that stress removed...that responsibility removed,so things are a little more relaxed.\" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff,who carried out the investigation,said: \"The takehome message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'.\" Her coauthor Oliver John added:\"Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner.\" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe,from the British Psychological Society,said the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children.\"If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life,then of course you'll be pleased to see them go,\" she said, \"But if you've built your life around your children you'll be terribly lonely.For some parents,their world falls apart when their children leave.\"", "qas": [{"question": "What is not always a bad thing?", "id": "f64c269745bbc27539252747941875c9", "answers": [{"answer_start": 101, "text": "an \"empty nest\""}]}, {"question": "Why do parents feel they have lost their purpose in life?", "id": "590d8d86c43a607ff4b497cf6ecdb72a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 222, "text": "fly the coop"}]}, {"question": "How long were American mothers born in the 1930s tracked?", "id": "6f6b9b026696ffaefa98ebb99ecce16d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 571, "text": "18 years"}]}, {"question": "In what journal is the study published?", "id": "e53b86b900f319c7d43551dd891ba390", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1144, "text": "Psychological Science"}]}, {"question": "Who carried out the investigation?", "id": "3a460bc8a5995f58f14173d0c9d44b5c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1313, "text": "Sara Gorchoff"}]}, {"question": "Who was the author of the study?", "id": "79c052ff0a095d7fd9770692c6941389", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1455, "text": "Oliver John"}]}, {"question": "Who said the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children?", "id": "75360abd76673701ff31bf2d926cde92", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1569, "text": "Dorothy Rowe"}]}, {"question": "If you've built your life around your children you'll be what?", "id": "44ecb452b3cedba0b83f06cacf168f2f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1931, "text": "terribly lonely"}]}]}]}, {"title": "A study suggests that although most students at UK u", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A study suggests that although most students at UK universities are happy with their courses, dissatisfaction has grown as fees rise.The study highlights a big variation in teaching time, and lists different ideas about the value of getting university degrees.

We do about four assignments each term, each of which is about 3,000 words.However, sometimes they are not that helpful.We hope to be given the right to write feedback after every assignment, but we had no feedback at all throughout the first year.We are given grades about three weeks after we hand the assignments in.There is no feedback on where we have gone wrong or how we might improve. Lee Millington, a creative-writing student I choose the courses because of its reputation.There is a lack of one-to-one teaching.I would like personalized feedback from an expert in my field of writing.Some of the lectures have been quite helpful but they try to use too many different styles of writing.For example, if you want to be a poet, you might find that the lectures focus too much on novels.

Cakes and sandwiches are brought in by footmen, yet you never see the Queen touch a thing. She simply sits beside a big silver plate, pouring cups of tea for everyone and carefully avoiding the cakes. At cocktail parties the Queen moves from group to group, chatting informally, and manages to make one glass of diet drink to last an entire evening. Tours abroad are difficult because hosts seem to believe the warmth of their welcome must be shown with wonderful state banquets . But the Queen has perfected the art of appearing to enjoy her meal without actually eating much. During one visit to the Pacific islands ofprefix = st1 /Tonga, a specially-prepared dinner was arranged in a hut made of wood and bamboo leaves. Deep holes were dug in the ground, filled with hot stones and baby pigs, and the pigs were slowly baked over several days. The Queen looked uneasily at her plate when she discovered a whole roast pig was her serving. Then she became uneasy when a turkey, some meat, bananas and an apple were also carried in for each guest. So she depended on her old favorite trick of talking with her host., King Tupou IV, carrying on a warm conversation. At the same time she pushed her food around her plate and only ate a piece of turkey and some fruit. Reporters traveling with her have noted that the Queen will sometimes seem so carried away by a foreign leader's political chat that she simply never has time to finish a meal before it is time to get up and make her speech. She will lift her fork to swallow a mouthful, then put it down again to make another point, leaving almost all of her meal untouched.", "qas": [{"question": "Who brings in cakes and sandwiches?", "id": "04e3c2934026a420639de7e4ea87503f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 176, "text": "footmen"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the big plate that the Queen sits beside?", "id": "00dc7652a23cb0b0108d203aec0f7b03", "answers": [{"answer_start": 257, "text": "silver plate"}]}, {"question": "What was dug in the ground in the Pacific islands ofprefix?", "id": "8a1d7fd82ef6ce8ff739a0d7aac88f5c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 860, "text": "Deep holes"}]}, {"question": "What were some of the items that the Queen was carrying in for each guest?", "id": "104f9694c61c47f3e2850225497d0a42", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1107, "text": "turkey, some meat, bananas and an apple"}]}, {"question": "Who was the Queen's old favorite trick of talking with her host?", "id": "467aaab61d0203a3d9670d8c3ac9f51a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1253, "text": "King Tupou IV"}]}, {"question": "What did Queen Tupou only eat when she pushed her food around her plate?", "id": "1557d23bf74c0968145d6dbdb159cbf6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1368, "text": "a piece of turkey and some fruit"}]}, {"question": "What does the Queen seem to be carried away by?", "id": "e9d86845bfb4e01a0aa68ab22d3ed968", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1496, "text": "a foreign leader's political chat"}]}, {"question": "How does the Queen lift her fork?", "id": "ad5babf77494598e1af2297ee1178945", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1653, "text": "swallow a mouthful"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Hello, Listeners.

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it.

The finding should remove fears that such laws could have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the last few years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer nations. Opponents often claim that bans could result in people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the main concerns as second-hand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Centre reviewed as many as 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after smoking bans came in. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births, and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were carried out. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut down following a public ban, says Been. But Been also says the studies could not completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, as a matter of fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This might be one of the most important things to know in order to strengthen legislation . Other studies have shown that rates of heart attack and stroke also tend to fall after smoking bans are introduced.", "qas": [{"question": "Which countries have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the last few years?", "id": "6622295c314c013313863561e5c91264", "answers": [{"answer_start": 349, "text": "Japan and Australia"}]}, {"question": "Which countries still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants?", "id": "8157220da37f1b7f81e70358ca209414", "answers": [{"answer_start": 478, "text": "the Netherlands and Germany"}]}, {"question": "How many US states have comprehensive bans?", "id": "28d526744c8209022110e539abf353f8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 563, "text": "half"}]}, {"question": "What harms children's airways in several ways?", "id": "0873a33767c595764e9ea12916ffae78", "answers": [{"answer_start": 821, "text": "second-hand smoke"}]}, {"question": "How many births did Jasper Been study?", "id": "8f56b042e0c36d7a10b9434c1dc0f839", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1128, "text": "2.5 million"}]}, {"question": "How much did asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fall within a year after smoking restrictions were carried out?", "id": "22662beff387b7d40120f5cbfcceb129", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1282, "text": "10 percent"}]}, {"question": "Who was more likely to quit or cut down after a public ban?", "id": "eeb44a8ecf12a8b6ad06af8375010502", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1412, "text": "pregnant women"}]}, {"question": "How many smoking bans were included in the study?", "id": "260f87edfaf6d2a1ce62c917a7d76d26", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1667, "text": "several"}]}, {"question": "What is one of the most important things to know about smoking bans?", "id": "dc57b6ffbb5556e700c6a837ef9763ad", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2030, "text": "strengthen legislation"}]}]}]}, {"title": "The fighting against youth smoking since I took offi", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The fighting against youth smoking since I took office I've done everything in my power to protect our children from harm.

This is a national tragedy that every American should be honor-bound to help prevent. For more than five years we've worked to stop our children from smoking before they start, launching a nationwide campaign to educate them about the dangers of smoking, to reduce their access to tobacco products, and to severely restrict tobacco companies from advertising to young people.

Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? N", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A house of cards? Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles -- and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan remembers, \"with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests -- building and card stacking -- soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \"Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level,\" he reports. \"And they weren't very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall down immediately.\" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he's gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be at the top.

He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles -- and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things.

But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \"Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level,\" he reports. \"And they weren't very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall down immediately.\" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he's gone on to win world records for even taller buildings.

I've decided to re-establish the 5-paragraph essay as the goal for the composition course. I interviewed some of my former students and they all agreed that being able to write critically and continuouslywas important to them. So next academic year, Term 1 will be like always: sentences to paragraphing. And Term 2 will work toward the 5-paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well. As for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course. I am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself.

I've decided to re-establish the 5-paragraph essay as the goal for the composition course. I interviewed some of my former students and they all agreed that being able to write critically and continuouslywas important to them. So next academic year, Term 1 will be like always: sentences to paragraphing. And Term 2 will work toward the 5-paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well. As for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course. I am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself.

Alexander Klose, CEO of Volvo Cars China, told Xinhua at the Ninth Tianjin International Automobile Trade Show, being held from Friday to Wednesday. Klose said Volvo Cars had entered a new time of fast development, adding that its sales volume in China in 2010. Up to the end of September, Volvo's global sales volume was up 12.5 percent year on year , compared with 52 percent year-on-year rise in China, he said. Two new Volvo sales centers opened in Beijing within merely one week in early October, about two months after east China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co acquired the Swedish brand from the US auto giant Ford for $1.5 billion in early August. Klose said he was confident of seeing tremendous growth in China's auto market in the next five years. \"As the Chinese government has increased the tax rate for large displacement cars already, we now have a lot of cars below three liters , and I think we'll stick to that strategy, as you can see now the XC60 which was introduced today is just two liters,\" he said. \"As the technology advances, we'll probably even see 1.6 liter engines or 1.5 liter engines in the future,\" he added. Volvo Cars is not the only automaker hoping to take advantage of China's rapidly growing auto market.

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \"We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\" Dane says. \"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. \"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\" he says.", "qas": [{"question": "Where is the solar and wind power used to transport people?", "id": "d9c974a1c0bed801ba75ea17e01ff2ed", "answers": [{"answer_start": 138, "text": "Sydney Harbor"}]}, {"question": "Who was given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards?", "id": "080a5c9c134dcd8687512ea3df2d994f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 153, "text": "Robert Dane"}]}, {"question": "How long has the Solar Sailor been in use?", "id": "e91363da1a63c8d96505654bf2696a17", "answers": [{"answer_start": 290, "text": "six months"}]}, {"question": "How many sources of energy does the Solar Sailor use?", "id": "f885faff62ba278f312771a79bf1a2e2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 310, "text": "four"}]}, {"question": "What type of solar panels does the Solar Sailor have?", "id": "0e1b5b9636842432c9d57e1b2c6a980f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 549, "text": "fiberglass"}]}, {"question": "How much energy does the solar panels increase from the sun?", "id": "916ce603cdde8f5f0fd9c64cd8ef6804", "answers": [{"answer_start": 769, "text": "40 percent"}]}, {"question": "How long does the electric motor run if there isn't much wind or a cloudy day?", "id": "72a0a32dc19c744f9811fb89befaf996", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1164, "text": "five hours"}]}, {"question": "What happens if the batteries are too low?", "id": "004eef6e5424be862918fc3ace992c47", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1212, "text": "the computer turns the generator on"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the book Dane wrote about the Solar Sailor?", "id": "e0454edcbca8c35d6431a7f228391035", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1422, "text": "insects"}]}]}]}, {"title": "TransLink is urging customers to avoid non-essential", "paragraphs": [{"context": "TransLink is urging customers to avoid non-essential travel today and to stay home where possible in the difficult weather conditions.

With lower-quality lenses and image sensors, smartphones probably won't replace professional video cameras anytime soon. Still, some creative filmmakers are extending the borders of smartphone moviemaking by shooting professional-quality films using only smartphones. Soon after Apple's iPhone 4 was released, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the one-and-a-half-minute film Apple of My Eye in only 48 hours. Audiences were fascinated with the film, in which a man and his grandfather connect emotionally while admiring a model train set in a store window. The filmmakers followed up their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told over nine, three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone films are here to stay. One sign is their inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival staged the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver by Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers enable her to brighten the lives of three lonely people.

White in these cases is the symbol of innocence or purity. Sometimes white is used in expressions that are not good. \"Whitewash\" is one such expression. At first, \"whitewash\" meant to paint over something with white paint to make it look better. However, it means something different today: to hide or to cover up mistakes or failures. A \"white elephant\" is another example of white used in a negative way. In ancient Thailand, a white elephant was regarded as a sacred animal, but it was very expensive to keep. The kings of those days presented a white elephant to the people they wanted to ruin. Once they received this holy, royal animal as a gift, they were not allowed to sell or kill it.

But experts are now warning that the current shoe fashions will be causing teenagers discomfort in the short term and storing up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular among teenage boys-with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat--so flat that the heel, which strikes the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and halt the damage.", "qas": [{"question": "What are the names of rock bands?", "id": "4145398f23ff4856d47ea3390e9012cc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Vans, Keds, Dollies"}]}, {"question": "What shoes are particularly popular among teenage boys with Keds and Vans?", "id": "fae4eed5e074b23d631ab55da9b79178", "answers": [{"answer_start": 402, "text": "KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides"}]}, {"question": "What are the worst shoes of all?", "id": "c2337dc2b4d88c0f74447718cb2f2506", "answers": [{"answer_start": 721, "text": "light and thin dolly shoes"}]}, {"question": "What is the problem with dolly shoes?", "id": "0f4d3f22a262561431ecf0dc9586963a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 764, "text": "partly their flatness"}]}, {"question": "What type of shoes have no string or heel?", "id": "8981c0488a591c328647dbe3b87a59b0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 818, "text": "ballet pumps"}]}, {"question": "What type of shoes are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward?", "id": "9534e2384039c76c8aaaceb4a99e5b47", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1176, "text": "heels"}]}, {"question": "How many women are in danger of wearing KEDS/VANS shoes?", "id": "1a33e64fb168641134e426bab7474c54", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1352, "text": "millions"}]}, {"question": "What type of professional can help a teen's walk and halt the damage?", "id": "54be4980137b44ece78edb5b92644966", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1840, "text": "podiatrist"}]}]}]}, {"title": "A third of primary schoolchildren in China are suffe", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A third of primary schoolchildren in China are suffering from psychological ill-health as a result of classroom stress and parental pressure, according to a study published on Tuesday. The problem is so bad that urgent measures are needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The investigation surveyed 2,191 pupils aged nine to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a ly prosperous coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of the youngsters said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys likelier to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained they struggled to cope with the amount of homework they were assigned. Over one-third reported headaches or abdominal pains - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school.

The problem is so bad that urgent measures are needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The investigation surveyed 2,191 pupils aged nine to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a ly prosperous coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of the youngsters said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys likelier to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained they struggled to cope with the amount of homework they were assigned. Over one-third reported headaches or abdominal pains - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \"The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities themselves are now invested in their only children,\" it says.

This custom exists today as part of the process of testing candidates for the doctor's degree. Generally, however, modem examinations are written. The written examination, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the nineteenth century. Perhaps it came into existence with the great increase in population and the development of modem industry. A room full of candidates for a state examination timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched over by managers, looks like a group of workers at an automobile factory. Certainly, during examinations teachers and students are expected to act like machines. One type of test is sometimes called an \"objective\" test. It is intended to deal with facts, not personal opinions. To make up an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each of which has only one correct answer.

Upon returning to the United States, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman.

A professor who conducts research over in the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we concentrate on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic , and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success -- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond -- may be exactly what limits us.

He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic , and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success -- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond -- may be exactly what limits us. No one ever told us that our way of seeing left out everything else.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the name of a female student who stared at the camera and beat her chest with her fist?", "id": "b9cf39743cf1b0f0fe92183167869dc2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 50, "text": "gorilla suit"}]}, {"question": "What went up all over when he asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who scored the perfect 15?", "id": "121bf64ecd1f295ac0587e5bdca5f8d2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 282, "text": "Hands"}]}, {"question": "How many people were at my table to count attention blindness?", "id": "90145ded1a5512329536b647ac46a15e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 536, "text": "three or four"}]}, {"question": "What is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain?", "id": "8cf598d9d973cadd326091de1c534e77", "answers": [{"answer_start": 801, "text": "Attention blindness"}]}, {"question": "What means that we've been missing everything else?", "id": "63b9a04a9b05a98cd77c6631e14961cb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1283, "text": "everything we've learned about how to pay attention"}]}]}]}, {"title": "My husband had just bought a new washing machine for", "paragraphs": [{"context": "My husband had just bought a new washing machine for me.

Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful.In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school.Duncan and his team found almost no relationship between how students did on the test and whom they sat beside in class, whom they hung out with after school and who lived in their block.The only meaningful link they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, scholars thought that a family's income heavily affected how well kids did in life.But that might not be the case.When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifetime achievement, she ran a series of experiments to measure it, finding such outcomes weren't caused by income.She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a kid has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting.He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children.He said \"Many parents I interviewed are anxious about their children's futures.But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they don't give their children 'the best' of everything.\" So at last, we decided to leave things as it were.More time with our kid is the best we can provide.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the name of the son that I stood with in our driveway in the past year?", "id": "151f88e389f571ed133a5db17de0f098", "answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "James"}]}, {"question": "How much time did James spend with his son?", "id": "c2280c7f9211ef8e4b5e2168434ff763", "answers": [{"answer_start": 244, "text": "less"}]}, {"question": "Who began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting?", "id": "93f8d10d7a7bed590151d3d27a25bd3d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1511, "text": "Lareau"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Spanish men will have to learn to change diapers and", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Spanish men will have to learn to change diapers and do dishwashing under the terms of a new law designed to strike a blow. The law, due to be passed this month, is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40% of men reportedly don't do housework at all. It will oblige men to \"share domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish parliament's justice commission. \"This will be a good way of reminding people what their duties are. It is something feminists have been wanting for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, who was behind what is an amendment to a new divorce law. Failure to meet the obligations will be taken into consideration by judges when determining the terms of divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may be given less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times longer on housework than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much work in the house. \"It is not just about housework, though,\" said Ms. Uria. A study five years ago by Spain's Center for Sociological Investigation concluded that fathers spent an average of 13 minutes each day looking after their children. Only 19 % of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third thought mothers should not work outside the home at all. The Change to the Spanish legal code will see domestic obligations added to a list of marital duties that currently includes fidelity, living together and helping one another.

The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface.

The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface.

Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing.

How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route.

One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What did others assign runners to different groups according to?", "id": "9c5825b3f126aa37fbda303f7cb79196", "answers": [{"answer_start": 53, "text": "ability"}]}, {"question": "How many participants attend the Rennsteig half marathon?", "id": "168ba012fb114f9ddc280cec21071a21", "answers": [{"answer_start": 213, "text": "6,000"}]}, {"question": "How long did the route pass through a wooden bridge?", "id": "3036ca6cb33a40768ba9d43798aa160a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 411, "text": "60m"}]}, {"question": "What did Treiber predict would risk an overload of runners if the bridge was to be used?", "id": "e00bcd5213f71f2a9dfd012a9c2d82a4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 562, "text": "mass start"}]}, {"question": "What was the risk of blocking at the Rennsteig half-marathon?", "id": "bee04ad033dbb23c28bab571fa8df1c8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 847, "text": "jams"}]}, {"question": "What was likely for the tunnel route?", "id": "013a129dd6cbde4f5e52bac5aa1d98fc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 886, "text": "no dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Where do dogs come from? Gray wolves are their ances", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Where do dogs come from? Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent about that. And researchers have suggested that dogs' origins can date back to Europe, the Near East, Siberia and South China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different kinds of DNA, Dr. Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs in much the same way that genetic studies have located the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, Dr. Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia, as the place where \"all the dogs alive today\" come from. The data did not allow precise dating of the origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of Oxford University, who is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not just the number of street dogs, but also the geographic breadth and the number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different kinds of DNA and the analytic methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved with the study, said he thought the Central Asia finding required further testing. He said he suspected that the origins of modern dogs were \"extremely messy\" and that no amount of sampling of living populations will be definitive. He said a combination of studies of modern and ancient DNA is necessary.", "qas": [{"question": "What are their ancestors?", "id": "efa0a4e01cd9fabad365833f5a6fb8d2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 25, "text": "Gray wolves"}]}, {"question": "Who is pretty consistent about dogs' origins?", "id": "9fbde3184e18bf08c311b3a510c11405", "answers": [{"answer_start": 58, "text": "Scientists"}]}, {"question": "Where can dogs' origins date back?", "id": "ed67a70991c78895b079c768524243bd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 170, "text": "Europe, the Near East, Siberia and South China"}]}, {"question": "What country is the newest and best candidate for a study of dogs from around the world?", "id": "cc463d0895fafb5f077e7da552749f4e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 218, "text": "Central Asia"}]}, {"question": "How many countries have dogs come from?", "id": "3f76ab3e51485350404190a1211faa30", "answers": [{"answer_start": 643, "text": "38"}]}, {"question": "What country is the place of origin for dogs?", "id": "044c5a54362a209d5b7913f8fcb8e5b2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 678, "text": "Central Asia"}]}, {"question": "Where did Dr. Boyko point out that all dogs alive today come from?", "id": "100f0e4c04a14b3ac59bda3ef289f596", "answers": [{"answer_start": 863, "text": "Central Asia"}]}, {"question": "How long ago did the data show that dogs originated from?", "id": "3e6f07a88c673a36ac4c38c06bcfaf16", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1028, "text": "15,000 years ago"}]}, {"question": "Where is Greger Larson from?", "id": "feddb724cc49ae5e4649afd3ea338a52", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1063, "text": "Oxford University"}]}, {"question": "What type of DNA did Dr. Larson praise?", "id": "28f80f5156f8afebfcfbc6b472c1d5a6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1439, "text": "DNA"}]}, {"question": "Who thought the Central Asia finding required further testing?", "id": "229b3f7aec39cb2d72d254071ff00014", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1469, "text": "Dr. Larson"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Many parents try hard to protect their kids from TV ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Many parents try hard to protect their kids from TV and Internet advertising.
