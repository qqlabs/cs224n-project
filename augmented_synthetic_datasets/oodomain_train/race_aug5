So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a fling about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Future, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a hebdomad and 2, 000 stat mi to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \" We're going somewhere we haven't been before, \" he says. \" In all possibility, there will be surprises. \" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seem like impossible ideas.", "qas": [{"question": "How deep have we gone into the earth until now?", "id": "c95d7fa1a27d52613f5f9609a13578f5", "answers": [{"answer_start": 459, "text": "7. 5 miles"}]}]}]}, {"title": "An experiment be carried out at British school into ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "An experiment be carried out at British school into the performance of new pupils.

A professor who conducts research over in the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature film of the human brainiac that, when we concentrate on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our lector was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that taping with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'five hundred scored the perfect  15 . Then he asked, \" And who saw the gorilla? \" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I be the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a cracking opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's non easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay aid means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success-- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond-- may be exactly what limits us.

A professor who conducts research over in the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we concentrate on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I ascertain that tape with the confuse basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many citizenry had counted at least a twelve basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect  15 . Then he asked, \" And who saw the gorilla? \" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or 4 in the large room to do so. He'ergocalciferol set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there experience been a trick, but he wasn't the one world health organization had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation.

How do such crowding problems come up, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear-road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid go denser. At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the concentration becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's theoretical account of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \" carrying capacity \" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions-for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the backward have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various grouping according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6, 000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could go either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided-and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge.

I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tape recording with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so 1 let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 second into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then enquire who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect  15 . Then he postulate, \" And who saw the gorilla? \" I raised my hand and constitute surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I think that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learn about how to pay attention means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for united states logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success-- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond-- may be exactly what limits us. No one ever told us that our way of seeing left out everything else.", "qas": [{"question": "What's the total number of basketball tosses by the players in white shirts in the video?", "id": "6b91ed0f3ba5728bbe032754305b660d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1317, "text": "15"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Plan your to-do list for the coming year?

The college admission process. If you are afraid you don't subject your children enough, the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades, you will have to answer for the consequences.

Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life?

Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have learn them how to fly.

To make it a realistic as substantially as exciting story, I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately, I am not good at any sport of any kind, let alone parachute jumping. My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand. He took me to a ground school day. The first day'siemens training included several hours of instruction only non my first drop from an airplane. For this, I had to wait until the following morning. The next morning, after a hurried, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were put on my back. Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped lento on the runway. Erstwhile on the plane, information technology was soon climbing. Iodin began to feel nervous. As we reached one thousand meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the aeroplane. The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped. \" Get ready, Joseph henry, \" Harry said. I moved carefully to the door. I wanted to cry, \" No, no, no! \" but no bible came. \" Jump! \" Harry called out loudly. \" Jump! \" To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I did jump. Away from the plane, and down, down I fell.
