{"data": [{"title": "\n\nA Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wildernes", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\n\nA Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots looking for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post-tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise.The next several scenes are back-and-forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, given the codename \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100,000-feet-plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot's thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3- to 5-second reaction-time advantage over any opponent. NATO's descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains.Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff).Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation--as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he's disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don't tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own.Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport--with the \"radio.\" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose-stepping in formation while patrolling.In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky in fact knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia--but even he does not know what the CIA and the SIS really have planned.That night Gant walks out to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, under instructions to be there at precisely 10:30 with the KGB shadowing him -- he is ordered ", "qas": [{"question": "Who refuse to kill Voskov?", "id": "2e4f24b1316749f18d5d38389c89d824", "answers": [{"answer_start": 894, "text": "Gant"}]}, {"question": "What prototype is under heavy guard?", "id": "c97a0438b5104c4dab7a6348ca171c1e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2224, "text": "MiG-31"}, {"answer_start": 1106, "text": "Firefox"}, {"answer_start": 1106, "text": "Firefox"}]}, {"question": "Who has got the wind of the operation and is already hot on Gant's tail?", "id": "0048e473297f4121a908db823526aefc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3980, "text": "KGB"}]}, {"question": "Who engages Gant in a dogfight?", "id": "1c7afb41143f47799472a21da1415c0d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2266, "text": "Voskov"}]}, {"question": "Where is the airbase located?", "id": "0415dbb4004f4665a52f0c793e0666c7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3769, "text": "Bilyarsk"}, {"answer_start": 3769, "text": "Bilyarsk"}]}, {"question": "Who barely reaches the Arctic ice?", "id": "287e34da316744ffaf0973177cc0b27e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 894, "text": "Gant"}]}, {"question": "Who is Clint Eastwood?", "id": "a250bc63684a3c7b1a8c905bc0bf8c25", "answers": [{"answer_start": 105, "text": "Major Mitchell Gant USAF"}]}, {"question": "Where did Gant live?", "id": "10efa84145beee5e448ba88b84a8ef11", "answers": [{"answer_start": 405, "text": "Vietnam"}]}, {"question": "How much thrust does the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31 deliver?", "id": "9d2bcc473440d33d360f2a71424b6049", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1202, "text": "50,000 pounds"}]}, {"question": "Where is the Firefox prototype located?", "id": "29699db5481fe9039d4c852d29a5833a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1677, "text": "Bilyarsk"}]}, {"question": "What corrupt businessman is known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union?", "id": "8ded24b4f9b1f787a44d921e32eeb399", "answers": [{"answer_start": 354, "text": "Leon Sprague"}]}, {"question": "Where is Leon Sprague sent to?", "id": "e4543afdc6cf16c06c17d8ef3f57e385", "answers": [{"answer_start": 461, "text": "London"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the underground network group that Gant is familiar with?", "id": "8ceb8205c726bb5cc0bcedc7c9f4a9fd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 665, "text": "Russian Jews"}]}, {"question": "Where does Gant take a taxi to?", "id": "30cb5b45af25c71314c5876980632020", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1070, "text": "Hotel Moscow"}]}, {"question": "Who finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31?", "id": "a4b4dc52ec3da70e7150acdb8b7db3ed", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1273, "text": "Colonel Kontarsky"}]}, {"question": "Who is the second-in-command of the KGB?", "id": "35741ba264de6d36b1a0af2865b218c8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1490, "text": "Dmitri Priabin"}]}, {"question": "Who knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia?", "id": "2cf088b4359dae7a8b8c994637e7d6d2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1595, "text": "Kontarsky"}]}]}]}, {"title": "\n\nIn olden times, England is in turmoil. With the de", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\n\nIn olden times, England is in turmoil. With the death of the King, noone can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, \"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England.\" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kaye to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, wherein resides a sorcerer named Merlin, and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home, and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and displays his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire.Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape.Arthur's tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouthing off' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes.Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages.Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that 'man will fly.' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he's often dreamed of soaring like a bird.

Following instructions from a mysterious man named Dane, she eventually ends up in Los Angeles.One night, while giving a lecture to an audience of people with whom she hopes to convince that vampires exist and aware that they attend when she speaks, she activates overhead ultraviolet lamps that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience before the humans. She is quickly arrested and harassed by a man named FBI Agent Norris whom she quickly learns that he is a 'familiar' (bug-eater) one of the many thousands of human followers of the vampires all over the world, placed to keep their activities covered up. After they release her from custody with a warning to keep quiet about the existence of vampires, she returns to her hotel room to find three people waiting for her; Paul (Rhys Coiro), Amber (Diora Baird) and Todd (Harold Perrineau) who had been sent by Dane to collect her in order to hunt down the vampire queen Lilith, whom they are convinced once out of the way, the vampires will fall into more-or-less form of dormancy as she is responsible for their every move and for keeping them hidden, when Stella asks if she is responsible for the incident at Barrow and is notified that she was. She is taken to meet Dane (Ben Cotton) and is shocked to discover that he too is a vampire, though due to a superficially inflicted wound he has maintained a grasp of humanity, only drinking blood from packaged hospital stocks he keeps.At first hesitant to join in on a plan to attack a vampire nest, Paul eventually convinces Stella to join them, telling her of his daughter being killed by one and his accusations of a vampire killing her resulting in a divorce with his wife.The following day, the four of them find their way to a vampire's nest and they are ambushed by a group of them. In the attempt to flee, Todd is bitten and turns after they lock themselves in a cellar room. When Paul hesitates, Stella manages to kill him by smashing in his head with a cinder block. They decide to wait for night when the vampires go out to feed in order to make their escape.After night falls, Dane comes and frees them, on their way out they capture a vampire. Taking him back to their base of operations, Dane interrogates the non-English speaking animalistic vamp with ultraviolet lamps, eventually following him back to another nest. They invade the nest and rescue a human they were using as a feeding station and with her memories of Lilith's lair aboard one of the ships on the bay they are able to plan an attack on her directly.At Dane's place, Stella and Paul get intimate and have sex. Meanwhile, Lilith (Mia Kirshner) decides that Agent Norris should prove his worth to become a vampire (in order to cure throat or lung cancer he has been suffering from) and he bites the neck of a captive girl, named Stacey (Katharine Isabelle), drinking her blood until dead. Afterward she turns him to hunt Stella and the others.Dane is killed when Norris arrives, and the others flee with the survivor from the nest, they travel to a boat yard and Jennifer points out the boat that they are set to sail to Alaska in for another 30 day feeding period.

Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about, \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the cellar, and another much older cadaver lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist.Driving down the 14-mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, although her eyes are occluded with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her opulently furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine to the corpse of Schweik. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris remains behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins pulsing with activity.

Jill is then menaced by the re-animated cadaver of Schweik.Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about he ineptitude of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears again to Liza that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in Room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel conceals. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and arid landscape. Suddenly afraid, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel parlor into the night. But Liza notices a disquieting fact about her sudden departure: Emily made no footfalls on the bare wooden boards as she ran, and neither did her seeing-eye dog.The next day, Liza ventures nervously into Room 36, a dingy phantasmal of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty light. She finds an ancient book, whose weirdly flesh-like cover bears the single word", "qas": [{"question": "What was Jill's mother's face burned by?", "id": "d94a42693350473581ff79dc91c91e04", "answers":

begins some years in the future from this", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\n\nThe film begins some years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society. Practically all the game characters are dressed in ridiculous and skimpy costumes", "qas": [{"question": "Which  technology will eventually grant Castle unlimited power over the populace?", "id":

film depicts the construction and ultimate dem", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\n\nThe film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \"Money\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot.

Alighting from the cab they tip the driver generously, bribing him to not say anything to anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for The Silver Queen, heading for Panama City, Panama, and seem excited and anxious.Also waiting for the same flight is Peggy Nolan, to whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a card thanking her for some favor. Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling cheap gardenias.Soon after, the flight gets ready to leave and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to be bossed around like a child.As they wait on the tarmac near the 'plane a car drives up and a well dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is being sent away with \"Uncle\" Pete until his father -- a mobster -- can follow later.As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, receives word that they will be transporting an anarchist back to Panama, but he assures the group there is nothing to worry about since the man will be in custody during the flight.\nThe prisoner is Vasquez, and is being accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp.After Larry the steward helps everyone get settled, the flight departs with its twelve souls aboard. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe indicates he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where beds have been made up and people are turning in for the night -- except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" -- thus cheating the hangman and himself out of $5,000.Pete tucks his young charge in for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy comes up to the cockpit to visit with Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her.Next morning the 'plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another stab at getting Bill to warm to her and is rebuffed again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy's been \"marked\" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her.Before boarding the 'plane a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe learns that she is engaged to her \"boss\" and they are eloping.As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather the Professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin which recounts how Tommy's father has been killed. Peggy again tries to help with Tommy, saying \"he needs a woman.\" But Pete is still being judgemental and answers \"he needs a lady.\" Mrs. Spengler intervenes and comforts Tommy.As the storm they are flying through gets rougher, the passengers strap themselves into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots turn back. As the 'plane rocks back and forth a couple of metal cylinders break loose and crash through the back door. Tommy comes perilously close to going out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him to Pete. Just then the 'plane dips sharply and Larry is tossed out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to steady the 'plane Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them. In the struggle the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez.With a damaged engine the Silver Queen crashes, and all eleven on board survive.

The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but while on stakeout the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers.The Mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy head Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) on apprehending the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull-witted uncle.After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb-skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.It is revealed here that the robberies are committed by a group of three dim-witted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as the \"Mastermind\", who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewellery from the last robbery is planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to clear Lassard's name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be 'leaking' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy.The Police Academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. It is revealed that the Mayor is the \"Mastermind\" and that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the Mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.As the movie closes, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string tying the balloon float is cut, lifting his chair and floating him up into the air as he shouts Proctor's name.\n\n", "qas": [{"question": "Who assigns the police to investigate the robberies?", "id": "fdb2561b4aaf488aa8dd730911b7b059", "answers": [{"answer_start": 95, "text": "mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars"}]}, {"question": "Who is revealed to be the \"Mastermind\"?", "id": "541844a0e187448998d19db853f2f273", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "who is guiding the group of three dimwitted criminals ?", "id": "2b74193b5283473c8d6fc0318ba26ebc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1723, "text": "Mastermind"}]}, {"question": "Who does the police academy do battle with ?", "id": "c688c0dc1f8c4a4abe5025ff174bdd33", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Did Nick get anywhere by distributing the flyers?", "id": "d95559caf8454658a7bef11b3aa6466c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 865, "text": "nowhere"}]}, {"question": "In whose office was stolen jewelry found?", "id": "2525ab9fac564cc1b3a27b6353bdc8df", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1978, "text": "Lassard's locker"}]}, {"question": "Who has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the mayor?", "id": "aa4c9734dbe74318804a82daa08f87b2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 136, "text": "Captain Harris"}]}, {"question": "How does Nick find out about the diamond he uses as bait?", "id": "d8e049e65b7f4edda8f887e44e4c53ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 901, "text": "paper"}]}, {"question": "What gang does the police academy find and do battle with?", "id": "944fce391f9b440a9b4cc44a2b792215", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who chases the leader?", "id": "bbf25c48c1454998a32209058a228999", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick"}]}, {"question": "What does Harris shout as he floats up in the air?", "id": "b2d80c4133494ee596e6e67219cc68fd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3032, "text": "Proctor's name"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the gang the police are looking for?", "id": "54f5ea8715d0408893b1f1201b6a6498", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who nabbed the diamond?", "id": "c60bb3a144ab4e3ca7700ac28224f8ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who is the mastermind ?", "id": "1c51bd10808a4504b8937920908f6703", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the officers' bravery?", "id": "11136749c9b44320a080f4f50a22eb2d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2763, "text": "Hurst"}]}, {"question": "Who distributes the flyers?", "id": "bf41d077ccdb4ddca1269ba500c5f31b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick McCoy"}]}, {"question": "Where does Nick deduce the robberies are occurring?", "id": "b95af67071d84907b8bf3a9f6b5a118f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2194, "text": "along a bus route"}]}, {"question": "What are the police investigating?", "id": "61d51cc05ac448948d09821b5b914ea3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 32, "text": "series of robberies"}]}, {"question": "What are the police assigned to investigate?", "id": "b15b8b2b09004bcc915e0ce657bf316d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2170, "text": "robberies"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the gang Nick is trying to take down?", "id": "973e8e8403ac4946bce30fb5e5aa6000", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the officers bravery the next day ?", "id": "bc0097fe33a4472e91ac2c6a8acd8bb8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2812, "text": "plaque"}]}, {"question": "What does Nick get an idea to use the diamond as?", "id": "261b0cf50dd64b979796b390e48d927d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 988, "text": "bait"}]}, {"question": "How many officers does Lassard have?", "id": "4fa75e952422e52f5fdd2bbbc1c73878", "answers": [{"answer_start": 432, "text": "seven"}]}]}]}, {"title": " Brink  (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) has recently taken Pu", "paragraphs": [{"context": " Brink  (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) has recently taken Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in an auto wreck.

That person, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approach and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post-tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-iv dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The next several scenes are back-and-forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union's latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \" MiG \" Mannequin 31, given the codename \" Firefox \" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: full stealth, twin engines each delivering 50, 000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100, 000-feet-plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small exploit), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot's thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3-to 5-second reaction-time advantage over any opponent. NATO's descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the cognitive operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to exist on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in fly and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation-- as a corrupt man of affairs named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Trades union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he's disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor wireless. What his handlers don't tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own. Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport-- with the \" radio. \" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldier goose-stepping in formation while patrolling. In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at daybreak, but not to move before then.

Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling cheap gardenia. Soon after, the flight gets ready to leave and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to be bossed around like a child. As they wait on the tarmac near the'plane a car drives up and a well dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is being sent away with \" Uncle \" Pete until his father-- a mobster-- can follow later. As the passengers circuit card, Bill, the pilot, receives word that they will be transporting an nihilist back to Panama, but he assures the group there is nothing to worry about since the man will be in custody during the flight. The prisoner is Vasquez, and is being accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After Larry the steward helps everyone get settled, the flight departs with its twelve souls aboard. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe indicates he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the rider compartment where beds have been made up and people are turning in for the night-- except for Crimp who contrive to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \" go for a walk \"-- thus cheating the hangman and himself out of $ 5, 000. Pete tucks his young boot in for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy comes up to the cockpit to visit with Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her. Next morning the'plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another stab at getting Bill to warm to her and is rebuffed again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy'atomic number 16 been \" marked \" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her. Before boarding the'plane a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe learns that she is engaged to her \" boss \" and they are eloping. As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather the Professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin which recounts how Tommy's father has been killed. Peggy again tries to help with Tommy, saying \" he needs a woman. \" But Pete is still being judgemental and answers \" he needs a lady. \" Mrs. Spengler intervenes and comforts Tommy. As the storm they are flying through gets rougher, the passengers strap themselves into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots turn back. As the'plane rocks back and forth a couple of metal cylinders break loose and crash through the back door. Tommy come perilously close to going out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him to Pete. Just then the'plane dips sharply and Larry is tossed out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to steady the'plane Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them. In the struggle the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine the Silver Queen crashes, and all eleven on board survive. The next dawn Joe and Bill admit to the professor that they were blown off", "qas": [{"question": "Who does Vasquez shoot dead ?", "id": "3d3b9e2d860cf265240b116599a2297b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "Judson"}]}]}]}, {"title": "The police force must investigate a series of robber", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The police force must investigate a series of robbery along a strip of land in the city.
