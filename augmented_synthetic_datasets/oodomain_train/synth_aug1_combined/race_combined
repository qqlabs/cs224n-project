As populations increase across Australia and the rest of the world, demand for water will also increase. If we don't reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through embodied water) the piss post will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation-\" if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target \"-but it's not that promiscuous. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable direction of our water imagination, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm,... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our human relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of comprise water efficient. There are many real world example given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to deliver water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives! www. savewater. com. au has been designed to help you respond to the challenge to become water efficient.

The inside of the earth is comparatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth be about 4, 000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest maw in Siberia, but bottomed verboten at about  septet. 5 miles  below the surface. The Mohole project, a U. S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantelpiece. Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily discontinue at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust---about 52, 800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What niggling we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten atomic number 26 into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2, 000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out information to the surface.

The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\"he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem.

She was forced to leave her husband because he didn't care about the family. At one point she suffered a nervous breakdown due to his cruel and uncaring behavior. She took her children with her and decided to leave their home, but didn't know her destination. This all took place in a small town in Kansas, called Frontenac. She had very little gas in the tank and no money at all and she didn't even manage to make it out of Frontenac. As she used up the gas she got into a panic .

In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, testing usually was made up of saying poetry aloud and giving speeches. In the European universities of the Middle Ages, students who were working for advanced degrees had to discuss questions in their field of study with people who had made a special study of the subject. This custom exists today as part of the process of testing candidates for the doctor's degree. Generally, however, modem examinations are written. The written examination, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the nineteenth century. Perhaps it came into existence with the great increase in population and the development of modem industry. A room full of candidates for a state examination timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched over by managers, looks like a group of workers at an automobile factory.

The 17-year-old girl defeated champion Serena Williams 6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships. A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion. Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years. Not even Anna Kournikova evoked such passion when she broke on to the scene. To look good on court is one thing, but Sharapova can actually play the game too. Extremely well. She proved it over 13 days at the world's most prestigious tournament. Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain-induced depression but also salvaged(;) the season for the woman's tour. Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament, having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice-champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither caused her much concern. \"I don't remember too much about the final,\" Sharapova giggled. \"I was in my own place.\" She will find it increasingly hard to find any place to call her own from now on after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sport. In Russia she is sensational news. She headlined the news bulletins and was telephoned by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin after her triumph. Sharapova will return to her adoptive Florida home knowing life will never be the same again. But the girl who arrived in the US aged seven with her father and just US$700 is determined not to let fame and riches detract from her number one love, tennis. \"I know things will start coming up and that many more things will want to get involved, but I want to keep my head cool and play tennis,\" she said.", "qas": [{"question": "Who has won the most times in Wimbledon?", "id": "15ad9584c174442284986b5f60ed2e2c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 225, "text": "Serena Williams"}]}, {"question": "Who was the first Russian to win a single title at Wimbledon?", "id": "e8d09d08364ce134f13f0310b6f1275f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 225, "text": "Serena Williams"}]}, {"question": "How many meters does Maria Sharapova have?", "id": "185f61f0a9937f54ab543aa45b7d5063", "answers": [{"answer_start": 490, "text": "1.83"}]}, {"question": "How many days did Maria Sharapova win at the world's most prestigious tournament?", "id": "5e975977c0cb29a50b9e3c5884497920", "answers": [{"answer_start": 790, "text": "13"}]}, {"question": "Who identified Sharapova as the most marketable woman in sport?", "id": "6d2fec32a0c77a1a18c57d74c4580b79", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1412, "text": "advertisers"}]}, {"question": "What is Maria Sharapova's title in Russia?", "id": "e92320004c7293ad01544546802d057d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1495, "text": "sensational news"}]}, {"question": "Who telephoned Sharapova after her triumph?", "id": "6158b6e9727291eb1172d0c600fbb92b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1593, "text": "Boris Yeltsin"}]}, {"question": "What is Sharapova's status in Russia?", "id": "981a9415d882d537ed65038d1cd15f8e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 653, "text": "sensational news"}]}, {"question": "Where will Sharapova return to?", "id": "b0d20a3f2b46ac918b63b267965e42a9", "answers": [{"answer_start": 822, "text": "Florida"}]}, {"question": "How old is Sharapova when she arrived in the US?", "id": "6b3e590fe40ef017db5525c0f1b2e34d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 918, "text": "seven"}]}]}]}, {"title": "It was a comfortable sunny Sunday.

With lower-quality lenses and image sensors, smartphones probably won't replace professional video cameras anytime soon. Still, some creative filmmakers are extending the borders of smartphone moviemaking by shooting professional-quality films using only smartphones. Soon after Apple's iPhone 4 was released, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the one-and-a-half-minute film Apple of My Eye in only 48 hours. Audiences were fascinated with the film, in which a man and his grandfather connect emotionally while admiring a model train set in a store window. The filmmakers followed up their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told over nine, three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone films are here to stay. One sign is their inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival staged the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver by Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers enable her to brighten the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes an actual journey he made from New York to London.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,\" one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. \"I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all the elbows,\" said another. How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2958, "text": "dangerous blocking"}]}, {"question": "How many people will run the London Marathon this weekend?", "id": "dec056c83aeb804c3b333596f57a19de", "answers": [{"answer_start": 57, "text": "over 30,000"}]}, {"question": "How many miles does the London Marathon run?", "id": "d90f620bbc90c9a18fb35e6a1bf651aa", "answers": [{"answer_start": 155, "text": "26"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the system in which jams appear?", "id": "77f6674b1368ebd3a8bc30205e1f2b3a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 686, "text": "road traffic flow"}]}, {"question": "Who is the Technical University of Dresden in Germany?", "id": "e0b5a5ef97e452ed2d16147cc35b2166", "answers": [{"answer_start": 705, "text": "Martin Treiber"}]}, {"question": "Who is Martin Treiber's collaborator?", "id": "1f92cdb2771bf1cecac9503bd18f08cf", "answers": [{"answer_start": 932, "text": "Gerard Whitham"}]}, {"question": "What did Lighthill and Whitham consider the traffic as?", "id": "f8abd82f1296b56cd2661ae8c1f47222", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1014, "text": "liquid flowing down a pipe"}]}, {"question": "How can Treiber calculate the flow rate of runners?", "id": "bf323b7a58e73ed1a365659187435d48", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1726, "text": "knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route"}]}, {"question": "How do some marathons start?", "id": "d3019b885ffe5874b31823f7627cce7a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1943, "text": "letting all the runners set off at once"}]}, {"question": "What did Treiber consider the traffic as?", "id": "2e7a894b59d9200ee73598b67c0b9a0f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 41, "text": "liquid flowing down a pipe"}]}, {"question": "What do some runners assign to different groups according to?", "id": "3965df94402ac2c778c8415ed4f2a1c0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1149, "text": "ability"}]}, {"question": "How many participants attend the Rennsteig half-marathon?", "id": "3b8663cf335fd53b8df3a5975e0758d1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1309, "text": "6,000"}]}, {"question": "What did Treiber's model predict would risk an overload of runners if the bridge was to be used?", "id": "1ff01ffc64b7549bee59d5a60d0cc69a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1658, "text": "mass start"}]}, {"question": "How could the danger be avoided?", "id": "947e9cf37898f6b62e3d26b5ffb9da05", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1739, "text": "by moving the starting point further back from the bridge"}]}, {"question": "What seemed likely for the tunnel route?", "id": "dbfe68bf1331beb5e05f876b9650e9c3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1982, "text": "no dangerous blocking"}]}, {"question": "What did others assign runners to different groups according to?", "id": "9c5825b3f126aa37fbda303f7cb79196", "answers": [{"answer_start": 53, "text": "ability"}]}, {"question": "How many participants attend the Rennsteig half marathon?", "id": "168ba012fb114f9ddc280cec21071a21", "answers": [{"answer_start": 213, "text": "6,000"}]}, {"question": "How long did the route pass through a wooden bridge?", "id": "3036ca6cb33a40768ba9d43798aa160a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 411, "text": "60m"}]}, {"question": "What did Treiber predict would risk an overload of runners if the bridge was to be used?", "id": "e00bcd5213f71f2a9dfd012a9c2d82a4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 562, "text": "mass start"}]}, {"question": "What was the risk of blocking at the Rennsteig half-marathon?", "id": "bee04ad033dbb23c28bab571fa8df1c8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 847, "text": "jams"}]}, {"question": "What was likely for the tunnel route?", "id": "013a129dd6cbde4f5e52bac5aa1d98fc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 886, "text": "no dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "More and more people take part in marathons these da", "paragraphs": [{"context": "More and more people take part in marathons these days-over 30, 000 people will run the London Marathon this weekend, for instance.

That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees how to deal with an active shooter situation in the work. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active hitman situation is when an armed somebody or people actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intention to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in US history, with 49 people killed in a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, exploiter have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office-- a calculator or a loving cup a pair of scissors-as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shooter training. Gallo says, which typically teachers people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \" lock down \" method is often  ineffective , he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the training's basic level, no one gets bolt down. But as the trainings become more advanced, players who make a wrong alternative be shot. There's no lineage; the screen just turns black slowly. If this sounds terrifying, that's the point, says Gallo. There are hatful of training programs to instruct employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving persona play with toy guns. But these trainings are basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even enjoying themselves. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they need to make up scared. \" SurviVR will take the fear and turn it into confidence. \" Gallo says.", "qas": [{"question": "What does Gallo think of the training programs involving role play with toy guns?", "id": "607fde26671e9ec78064b2a48bb88e8f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1256, "text": "ineffective"}]}]}]}, {"title": "You're in your office when you learn there's someone", "paragraphs": [{"context": "You're in your office when you learn there's someone with a gun wandering outside.

There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in US history , with 49 people killed in a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office--a computer or a cup a pair of scissors-as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shooter training. Gallo says, which typically teachers people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \"lock down\" method is often ineffective, he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the training's basic level, no one gets killed. But as the trainings become more advanced, players who make a wrong choice be shot. There's no blood; the screen simply turns black slowly. If this sounds terrifying, that's the point, says Gallo. There are plenty of training programs to teach employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving role play with toy guns. But these trainings are basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even enjoying themselves. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they need to be scared. \"SurviVR will take the fear and turn it into confidence.\" Gallo says.", "qas": [{"question": "What does Gallo think of the training programs involving role play with toy guns?", "id": "f4536f1002e84e0ea74aba979bd89468", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1245, "text": "ineffective"}]}, {"question": "What happens when you're in your office?", "id": "f09789918a72be21134a8ce1b63c2669", "answers": [{"answer_start": 22, "text": "when you learn there's someone with a gun wandering outside"}]}, {"question": "What can you hear when you're in your office?", "id": "1eeb1088965bcdf0e06a03a0ae7e156e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 96, "text": "gunshots and screams"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the virtual reality program that trains employees how to deal with an active shooter situation in the workplace?", "id": "5bfea8c985caf57788079a1763b5cdc8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 205, "text": "SurviVR"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the virtual reality headset released earlier this year?", "id": "2879bec1065d19bf19bff0fa96d4b5e2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 328, "text": "HTC Vive"}]}, {"question": "How many deaths were caused by an active shooter situation in the U.S. last year?", "id": "f3b8f7c2e5e013397f56294ad25fe232", "answers": [{"answer_start": 664, "text": "231"}]}, {"question": "How many people were killed in a nightclub in Orlando?", "id": "dfcb2bfd30e941a725311911183ff557", "answers": [{"answer_start": 750, "text": "49"}]}, {"question": "How many options do users have in the training situation?", "id": "418c5b34de2cc01e419dc886933eeb50", "answers": [{"answer_start": 832, "text": "four"}]}, {"question": "What is SurviVR an improvement on?", "id": "f4c045dd81ab3ba72afb086ca2c14724", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1097, "text": "standard active shooter training"}]}, {"question": "How many options do users have in a training situation?", "id": "45665043366f01abc51179033a40e3aa", "answers": [{"answer_start": 38, "text": "four"}]}, {"question": "What does Gallo teach people to do?", "id": "8294606d0fa466b2a14b3bf95c6c2bc2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 384, "text": "lock themselves in place and hide"}]}, {"question": "What happens in the training's basic level?", "id": "c4f359fb8eb4b16a0fbbf8d8af552159", "answers": [{"answer_start": 553, "text": "no one gets killed"}]}, {"question": "What happens as the trainings become more advanced?", "id": "ab84ef5190f051e9f4645a5adf902a3e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 616, "text": "players who make a wrong choice be shot"}]}, {"question": "What type of violence does Gallo say employees need to deal with?", "id": "9bb07472b585336b632c785e8339db09", "answers": [{"answer_start": 844, "text": "workplace violence"}]}, {"question": "What are the trainings that teach employees how to deal with workplace violence?", "id": "906678d1d93087963c33443f064d95b5", "answers": [{"answer_start": 943, "text": "games"}]}, {"question": "What color does the screen turn slowly?", "id": "64d5b3157889674ab2c8889bcbbfb349", "answers": [{"answer_start": 177, "text": "black"}]}, {"question": "What type of violence does a training program teach employees to deal with?", "id": "d980a5d53fa45cbc090dc0c894485a24", "answers": [{"answer_start": 322, "text": "workplace violence"}]}, {"question": "What does Gallo say employees are doing with their employees?", "id": "f5821ae7c1cddf8bf5e66bf9e60d0f27", "answers": [{"answer_start": 455, "text": "relaxed and even enjoying themselves"}]}, {"question": "What is the fear of a shooter?", "id": "2aac482f7662771d9e6e3a45e1b021ea", "answers": [{"answer_start": 641, "text": "confidence"}]}]}]}, {"title": "_ (from How Do Animals Move?)
