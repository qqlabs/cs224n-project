Some characters are evidence to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the fight. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has  three  battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their future guest for the show-genius recluse Ken Castle, the lord of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the plot, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one fight, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back). After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick knocked out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sit in his cell, somebody opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other position knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.

On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a biz called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making  Castle  the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmate who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison prison term. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).

He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can do them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get down paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the rich person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by state that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else.

Though the film'sec symbolism is open to interpretation, the rampart itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening euphony is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \" The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot \". During the following scene, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters'real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who give way in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. The picture then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his padre died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \" Money \" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective female parent who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror. Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \" worms \". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident breathe in by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dyke Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform. The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \" Waiting for the Worms \". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.

Brink later make out for Gramps (Lionel Barrymore). Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and alleviate that someone else could see the stranger; he was not just a dream or apparition. Pudding tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree leave have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spend much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting.

Helium offers farther proof of his power by shooting  Mr. Grimes  (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died. Dr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to let Death cut down so people who are suffering can find release. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pud is delivered to Demetria's custody.
